Background
Doge is an internet slang for dog that circulated around the internet late 2013 that became an internet meme. 
It is associated with pictures of Shiba Inus, a dog breed, accompanied by colourful text in Comic Sans Ms which is 
written in broken english. 
The program is inspired by incremental games such as Cookie Clicker by Orteil where the main goal of the 
game is to click a cookie to gain more cookies and to buy upgrades which enhance cookie collection. Most of these 
incremental games are left in the background to gather resources while the player performs other tasks while 
occasionally checking on the program to buy more upgrades with their newfound cookies.

How to play
When starting up the game a picture of a doge is located on the center of the screen. 
By clicking on that doge allows you to generate more doge and buy upgrades. There is no “true” end
to the game as with the nature of most incremental games. The point of the game is to allow the user
to relieve stress by transferring it into producing more lovely doge and satisfy their need for riches. 
(In doge of course) Many other features are available throughout the program and all are based around the production of doge
